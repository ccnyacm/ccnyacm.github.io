# CCNY ACM Website

[Official Website](http://ccnyacm.github.io/) of City College of New York's ACM Club.

This is still a work in progress.

## Support:
This website now fully supports all MODERN desktop browsers. Tested on Microsoft Edge, IE 11, Firefox, Chrome, Safari.

If you are not on the latest family of browsers, we cannot guarantee support yet. We have also yet to test on mobile platforms and browsers, that is coming soon.

## Technologies:
This was built using [Pure](https://github.com/yahoo/pure/) <3, [bxSlider](http://bxslider.com), [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com), and [Jorge Yao](https://github.com/codenameyau)'s awesome [flip.js](https://github.com/codenameyau/flip.js).
